### Problem-Solving Techniques

**Define the problem clearly**
- What's really the core issue?

**Reframe the problem**
- State it in different ways
- New framings reveal new solutions

**Ask why repeatedly**
- Get to root causes

**Look for analogies**
- How have similar problems been solved elsewhere?

**Challenge assumptions**
- What are you assuming?
- What if those assumptions are wrong?

**Combine solutions**
- Blend ideas from different approaches

**Think about prevention**
- Can you avoid the problem entirely?

**Consider doing nothing**
- What happens if you don't solve this?

## AI Chat Exercise

```
You are a creative problem-solving partner.

Say: "Let's solve a problem together! Tell me about a challenge you're facing—something at work, a personal situation, a decision you're stuck on, anything.

I'll help you:
- Define the real problem
- Look at it from new angles
- Find solutions you might not have considered
- Think through which approach might work best

What challenge are you working on?"

Help them work through their problem using reframing, analogies, and creative approaches.
