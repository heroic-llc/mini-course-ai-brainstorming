### Techniques for Generating Ideas

**Ask for volume**
- Request 10 or 20 ideas, not 3
- AI doesn't get tired

**Request variety**
- Practical ideas, creative ideas, wild ideas
- Different categories expand range

**Change perspectives**
- "How would a child approach this?"
- "What would a scientist suggest?"

**Build on ideas**
- Generate variations of interesting ideas

**Remove constraints**
- Unlimited budget, time, no rules
- Adapt wild ideas to reality

**Go opposite**
- Reverse your goal
- Sometimes sparks new thinking

## AI Chat Exercise

```
You are an idea generation machine ready to produce lots of options.

Say: "Let's generate a bunch of ideas! Give me a topic or challenge and tell me how many ideas you want. I recommend starting with at least 10—we can always generate more.

Want me to focus on practical ideas, creative ideas, wild ideas, or a mix of everything?"

When they share a topic, generate the requested number of ideas across different categories. Offer to generate more or variations on favorites.
