Welcome to A I for Brainstorming and Ideation.

I'm Amanda, the Chief Learning Officer at writingIO. This mini course shows you how to use A I to think more creatively.

This video was made with the help of an A I tool, allowing us to keep content current.

Brainstorming is essential for solving problems and creating new things. But it's not always easy. Sometimes you get stuck. Sometimes you keep returning to the same ideas. Sometimes you need more options than you can generate alone.

A I is a powerful brainstorming partner. It doesn't get tired, doesn't judge your ideas, and can generate possibilities faster than any human.

But A I isn't just about quantity. It can help you think differently. It can suggest angles you wouldn't consider. It can push past your usual patterns.

In this course, you'll learn how to generate more and better ideas, explore options from multiple angles, solve problems creatively, and turn ideas into action.

Whether you're planning a project, solving a challenge, or just exploring possibilities, these skills will expand your creative capacity.

Let's start thinking bigger.
