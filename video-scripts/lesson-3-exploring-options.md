Now let's explore options more deeply.

Generating ideas is just the start. The next step is exploring the most promising ones to understand them better.

Expand on specifics. When an idea interests you, ask A I to develop it further. What would this look like in practice? What would the first steps be?

Examine from multiple angles. Ask A I to analyze an idea from different perspectives. What's great about this? What could go wrong? What's missing?

Consider stakeholders. Who would be affected by this idea? Ask A I what different groups might think about it.

Explore variations. Ask for different versions of the same core idea. What if we did this but smaller? Bigger? Faster? Simpler?

Test with scenarios. Describe hypothetical situations and ask how the idea would work. What happens if demand is higher than expected? What if resources are limited?

Identify requirements. What would we need to make this work? A I can help you think through resources, skills, and conditions.

Compare options. When you have several promising ideas, ask A I to compare them. What are the tradeoffs between these approaches?

The goal is to understand your options thoroughly before deciding. A I helps you think through possibilities you might otherwise overlook.
