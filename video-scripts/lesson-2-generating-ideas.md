Let's talk about generating ideas with A I.

The first rule of brainstorming is quantity before quality. You want lots of ideas before you start judging them. A I excels at this.

Ask for volume. Request ten ideas, not three. Or twenty. A I doesn't get tired, so take advantage of that.

Request variety. Ask for ideas across different categories. Give me five practical ideas, five creative ideas, and five wild ideas. This expands the range.

Change perspectives. Ask A I to brainstorm as different people. How would a child approach this? A scientist? An artist? A skeptic? Different perspectives generate different ideas.

Build on ideas. When you see something interesting, ask A I to generate variations. Give me five versions of that idea.

Remove constraints temporarily. Ask what you would do with unlimited budget, unlimited time, or no rules at all. This often reveals possibilities you can adapt to reality.

Go opposite. Ask A I for the opposite of what you're trying to do. Sometimes reversing an idea sparks something new.

Combine randomly. Share two unrelated concepts and ask A I to combine them. Random combinations often produce surprising ideas.

Don't filter too early. Let A I generate freely. You can sort through ideas later. First, get them all out.
