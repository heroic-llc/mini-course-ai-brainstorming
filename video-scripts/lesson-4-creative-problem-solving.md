Let's look at creative problem solving with A I.

When you're facing a challenge, A I can help you find solutions you wouldn't think of alone.

Define the problem clearly. Before brainstorming solutions, make sure you understand the problem. Ask A I to help you clarify. What's really the core issue here?

Reframe the problem. Sometimes a different framing reveals different solutions. Ask A I to state the problem in three different ways. New framings often unlock new approaches.

Ask why repeatedly. Get to root causes. Why is this a problem? And why is that? Keep asking until you understand the deeper issue.

Look for analogies. Ask A I how similar problems have been solved in other fields. How do hospitals handle this kind of challenge? What about restaurants? Sports teams?

Challenge assumptions. Ask A I to identify assumptions you might be making. Then ask what happens if those assumptions are wrong.

Combine solutions. Sometimes the answer isn't one solution but a combination. Ask A I to blend ideas from different approaches.

Think about prevention. Instead of solving the problem, can you prevent it? Ask A I how to avoid the problem altogether.

Consider doing nothing. Ask A I what happens if you don't solve this. Sometimes the best solution is accepting the situation.

Creative problem solving means expanding your options before narrowing down. A I helps you see possibilities.
